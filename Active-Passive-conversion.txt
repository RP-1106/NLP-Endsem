Here's a breakdown of a rule-based model to identify and convert sentence voice (active/passive) 
along with an algorithmic approach:

Model Components:

Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Identify the grammatical role (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) 
of each word in the sentence. Libraries like NLTK (Python) or spaCy (Python) can be used.

Verb Phrase Identification: Locate the verb phrase (main verb and its modifiers). This is 
crucial for voice identification.

Passive Voice Markers: Check for the presence of the auxiliary verb "be" (is, was, be, been) 
followed by the past participle of the main verb (e.g., "The cake was baked by me").

Algorithm:

Input Sentence: Take the sentence you want to analyze.

POS Tagging: Use a library to perform POS tagging on the sentence.

Verb Phrase Identification: Identify the verb phrase by finding the main verb and any adverbs or 
auxiliary verbs associated with it.

Active or Passive Check:

If the verb phrase consists only of a main verb (e.g., "The dog barks"), the sentence is in the 
Active Voice.
If the verb phrase includes "be" followed by the past participle (e.g., "The letter was written by 
me"), the sentence is in the Passive Voice.
Voice Conversion (Optional):

Active to Passive:
Identify the subject and object of the sentence.
Move the object to the beginning of the sentence and make it the subject.
Change the main verb to the "be" verb conjugated according to tense + past participle of the 
original verb. (e.g., "The dog barks" -> "The ball is barked by the dog")

Passive to Active:
Identify the subject and object of the sentence.
Move the object (often following the preposition "by") to become the subject.
Change the verb phrase to remove the "be" verb and use the past participle as the main verb. 
(e.g., "The letter was written by me" -> "I wrote the letter")

Limitations:
This approach might struggle with complex sentences with multiple clauses or non-standard verb forms.
Identifying the intended subject/object can be challenging in ambiguous cases.

Further Enhancements:
Include a dictionary lookup to handle irregular verbs and their past participles.
Consider dependency parsing to understand the grammatical relationships between words for more 
accurate subject/object identification.
