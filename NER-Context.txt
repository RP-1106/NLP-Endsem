Here's an algorithm for building a model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and finding words that 
provide context to the NER word:

Model Building:

Data Preparation:
Acquire a labeled NER dataset where text is annotated with tags for named entities
(e.g., Person, Location, Organization).
Preprocess the text data by performing tasks like tokenization (splitting into words) and lowercasing.

Feature Engineering (Optional):
Extract features from the text that can help identify named entities. Examples include:
Word itself (unigrams)
Combinations of nearby words (bigrams, trigrams)
Capitalization patterns
Part-of-speech tags

Model Selection and Training:
Choose a suitable model architecture for NER, such as:
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs): Popular choice for NER due to their ability to capture 
dependencies between words.
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTMs): Powerful neural network architecture for 
sequence modeling tasks like NER.
Train the model on the prepared data with labeled entities.

Finding Contextual Words:
Utilize Model Predictions:
Once trained, use the NER model to predict entity labels for new text.

Windowing Approach:
Define a window size (number of words before and after) around the identified named entity.

Context Word Extraction:
Extract all words within the window that are not themself the named entity. These words provide 
context for the entity.

Algorithm:
Input: Sentence and pre-trained NER model
Preprocess Sentence: Tokenize and lowercase the sentence. (Optional: Extract features)
NER Prediction: Run the sentence through the NER model to get predicted entity labels for each word.
Identify NER Words: Find all words with labels corresponding to named entities (e.g., Person, Location).
Context Extraction (for each NER word):
Define a window size (e.g., +/- 2 words).
Extract all words within the window surrounding the NER word, excluding the NER word itself.
These extracted words provide context for the named entity.

Example:
Sentence: "Barack Obama, the former president of the United States, visited Paris."
NER Prediction: (Person, B-LOC, I-LOC, I-LOC, O, O, O, O)
NER Words: Barack Obama, Paris (United States is not considered here as window is +/- 2 words)
Context for "Barack Obama": former, president
Context for "Paris": visited

Limitations:
The window size for context extraction might need adjustments based on the task and sentence complexity.
This is a simplified approach, and more sophisticated methods can involve dependency parsing to 
understand the grammatical relationships between words for richer context.
