While building a perfect model from scratch is complex, here's an algorithmic approach for a 
rule-based system to improve the order of jumbled words:

Algorithm:

Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:

Identify the part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for each word in the jumbled sentence. 
You can use libraries available in various programming languages for this task.
Identify Key Elements:

Look for nouns (people, places, things) and verbs (actions). These are crucial elements for building 
a sentence.

Subject-Verb Agreement:
Check for subject-verb agreement. A singular noun needs a singular verb, and vice versa. This can 
help identify potential starting points for the sentence.

Prepositional Phrase Placement:
Identify prepositional phrases (groups of words starting with prepositions like "in," "on," "with"). 
These typically modify other words in the sentence.

Dependency Parsing (Optional):
For a more sophisticated approach, consider dependency parsing. This reveals the grammatical 
relationships between words (subject, object, modifier).

Build the Sentence:
Start with a verb or noun phrase identified in step 2.
Based on POS tags and agreement, attach other words that logically connect and modify the 
initial phrase.
Use prepositions to connect phrases meaningfully (e.g., "The cat" + "sat" + "on" + "the mat").

Refine and Evaluate:
Use common sense and factual knowledge to refine the sentence.
Check for nonsensical sentences (e.g., "Cat eat house").

Limitations:
This approach might struggle with complex sentences, sarcasm, or double meanings.
Identifying the most logical sentence structure can be challenging with limited context.
Alternative Approaches:

Dictionary and Collocation: Utilize a large dictionary to check word co-occurrence patterns and 
build grammatically possible combinations.
Statistical Methods: Train a model on a large corpus of text data to learn word order probabilities 
and generate syntactically correct sentences. (This approach technically uses pre-trained data)
